# Working with pagination in GraphCMS

[Join our Slack](https://slack.graphcms.com)

This example demonstrates ways you can paginate GraphCMS queries.

* [Generate numbered pages](/src/pages/products/[page].js). This example generates a number of static pages based on a total count and a 'per page' limit.
* [Larger result sets](/src/pages/index.js). GraphCMS has a default [result set size](https://graphcms.com/docs/guides/migrating#result-set-size) of 100 entries, which can be increased up to 1000 entries. This example using a [`for await`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/for-await...of) statement to 'loop' requests until all data matching the desired query is returned.

This example is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) and [`graphql-request`](https://github.com/prisma-labs/graphql-request).
